Polyps are one of two forms of the cnidarians. Polyps may be sexual or asexual. The other body form is the medusa. When medusae mate, the result may be polyps, when polyps replicate, the result may be medusae. The details vary between species. Certain animal species are polyps all the time. Jellyfish polyps turn into 10–15 jellyfish and die.

In many cases the asexual buds formed do not separate from the parent but remain, thus forming colonies or 'stocks'. These may reach a great size, and contain a vast number of individuals. Slight differences in the method of budding produce great variations in the form of the colonies. The reef-building corals are polyp-colonies, strengthened by the formation of a firm skeleton.

Both forms live in water.

Montreal (, spelled Montréal in French) is a city in the country of Canada. It is the largest city in the province of Quebec and the second-largest city in Canada. 

Montreal is built on an island sitting in the Saint Lawrence River. More than three million people live in the Montreal region. At the center of Montreal is a mountain called Mount Royal.

Most of the people who live in Montreal speak French, but English is commonly spoken as well.

The origin of the name 'Montréal' is derived from Mons realis, which means 'Mount Royal' in latin.

Montreal has always played a very important part in the history and development of Canada, and continues to be a large Canadian industrial and commercial center, as well as a major sea port (via the Saint Lawrence River). It once was the largest city in Canada, before Toronto grew to be larger. 

Montreal is a very historical and culturally interesting place for visitors. One can visit the Old City in horse drawn carriages, where many buildings from the earliest years are standing proud, all of which is a constant reminder (and source of inspiration) to describe a lot about the way of life that started in the New World, when Montreal was just a fur trading outpost belonging to France over 350 years ago.

Many large corporations have their main offices in Montreal. The city is home to four major Universities, harbouring students from all parts of Canada and from all over the world.



Montreal features many beautiful churches (Montreal is referred to locally as 'the city of a hundred churches'), including the largest church in Canada, and also many important art, history, and science museums. You can also visit the location of the 1967 World's Fair, where today, as well as many other attractions, one will find the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve Formula One automobile race course. Also of interest is the site where the 1976 Summer Olympic Games were held, and the modern architecture of the Olympic stadium (the 'Big O') and its tall inclined observation tower (the highest inclined tower in the world); now a landmark of Montreal.

A lot of Montrealers are interested in hockey, and Montreal has its own ice hockey team called the Montreal Canadiens.

A Wordless Book is a Christian evangelistic device. Most believe that it was created by the famous London Baptist preacher Charles Haddon Spurgeon. It is called a "book", as it is usually has pages, but it can also be shown on a single page or banner.

The Brahui (Urdu spelling: بروہی) or Bravi (براوِ) language, spoken by the Brahui, it is the only Dravidian language mainly spoken in Pakistan, although it is also spoken in Afghanistan and Iran. The 2005 edition of Ethnologue reports some 2.2 million speakers, 90% of whom live in Pakistan. In Pakistan it is mainly spoken in the Kalat region of Balochistan.

Although it is a Dravidian language, it has been heavily influenced by the Iranian languages spoken in the area such as Balochi.

Brahui is often considered to be a remnant of a formerly more widespread Dravidian language family that was speculated to have reduced during the Indo-Aryan migration. It is also sometimes speculated that Brahui might be a direct legacy of the Indus Valley Civilisation. However, one polar opposite view is that Brahuis migrated up to Baluchistan in the 13 or 14th century or by a late immigration that took place after 1000 CE.

An official is someone who holds an office (i.e. function, mandate) in an organisation, of any kind. A public official is an official of central or local government.

The term officer is close to being a synonym (but has more military connotations). A functionary is someone who carries out a particular role within an organisation; this is quite a close synonym for official, as a noun, but with connotations closer to bureaucrat. 





Spotlight is the debut solo mainstream single release by American singer-songwriter Patrick Stump. The single was released on Stump's website on November 29th, 2010 with another version of the song. The original release for the single is officially called "Spotlight (Oh Nostalgia)", but the second version that was released with it was called "Spotlight (New Regrets)" which has a more up-tempo, electronic sound to it than that of "(Oh Nostalgia)". The song will appear on Stump's debut album Soul Punk. 

Patrick Stump has unveiled a video of him performing "Spotlight (New Regrets)" live on his newly redesigned website as of 20 December, after both "Spotlight" versions cracked 100,000 YouTube views the nights before. The clip features Patrick Stump simultaneously singing and playing some instruments, including an electric drum and a synthesizer, in his studio. According to the clip's title, he refers to himself as a "one man band".

On November 29, Patrick Stump released "Spotlight" on his website, a likely single for his upcoming album. Two different versions of the song were available; "Spotlight (New Regrets)" and "Spotlight (Oh Nostalgia)". He also included download links for both songs. The website views a message from Patrick claiming he could not decide between the two versions and asked his fans to vote in a poll, also on his website, for the public's preference as to which version should appear on the album.

Stump has performed the song at his concerts for press promotion.

An unofficial music video was uploaded to Patrick Stump's official YouTube channel.
